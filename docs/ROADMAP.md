# Roadmap

How Eloram gets from an empty repo to ARAM: Mayhem in a browser tab. Each phase ends with
`scripts/ci.sh` green and is pushed before the next starts. `NETCODE.md` is what the netcode phases
build; `DESIGN.md` is what the sim phases build.

## 0. The research, written
`NETCODE.md` (League's netcode from Riot's posts, our three netcodes beside it, what we build and
what we turned down), `DESIGN.md` (the mode at League's numbers, in our names), this file.

## 1. The workspace and the copied core
Before Colony's workspace, toolchain and lints; its counting allocator, bit writer, acks,
quantizers, storage, maths, jitter buffer, metrics, WebTransport endpoint and admission, and a Bevy
scene that says hello to the server from a browser.

## 2. The match, headless
The Causeway's navgrid, paths, motion and vision; units; the effect system; five champions, a
dozen augments, a few items; minions, turrets, the economy and the augment screens; a match from
first wave to a fallen nexus between bots. Golden hashes native and wasm over a whole match, no
allocation in a tick, a bench.

## 3. The netcode, end to end
Commands and orders, team-filtered deltas against acked baselines, missiles as events, the record
being written; the client's clock, prediction and interpolation; the server's shards, sessions,
lobby and bots; bots over WebTransport. A lossy-link test (prediction error, orders applied once),
the vision-leak oracle, no allocation in a shard tick, matches a core.

## 4. The client, playable
The Bevy client: the camera, orders by mouse and keys, champions, minions, missiles drawn on the
predicted clock, fog, the HUD, the shop, the augment cards. You and nine bots in a browser.

## 5. Mayhem, the record, spectating, Elo Pros
The augment set across four screens, Combo Breaker, headliners, more champions. The referee,
replays and the 60 s spectator feed from the record. Wallet sign-in, `/status.json` and
`/online.json`, publishing to the store.
